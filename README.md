# Simple Memory Game

## Description
This project is a simple memory game. Try to remember the position of the letters displayed on screen and match them together. The project is not based on any tutorials; instead, it's a product of my own experimentation and exploration of ideas.

I enjoy undertaking quick projects like this for fun, as they provide an opportunity to experiment with different concepts and technologies. Moreover, these projects serve as quick refreshers, allowing me to sharpen my skills in a hands-on manner.

Feel free to explore the code and provide any feedback or suggestions. Enjoy!
